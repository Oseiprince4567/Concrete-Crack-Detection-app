# Concrete-Crack-Detection-app
This app demonstrates a complete machine learning deployment pipeline for concrete crack detection, beginning with a rigorously prepared and balanced image dataset (40,000 total images, 227Ã—227 RGB, no augmentation), moving through model training in TensorFlow/Keras, and culminating in a Streamlit-powered browser app.
